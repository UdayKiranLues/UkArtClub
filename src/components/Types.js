            <p style={{ color: '#000', textAlign: 'start', fontSize: '25px' }} >
            Impressionism, French Impressionnisme, a major movement, first in painting and later in music,
            that developed chiefly in France during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Impressionist
            painting comprises the work produced between about 1867 and 1886 by a group of artists who shared
            a set of related approaches and techniques. The most conspicuous characteristic of Impressionism
            in painting was an attempt to accurately and objectively record visual reality in terms of transient
            effects of light and colour. In music, it was to convey an idea or affect through a wash of sound rather
            than a strict formal structure. </p>

            <p style={{ color: '#000', textAlign: 'start', fontSize: '25px' }} >
            Fauvism, style of painting that flourished in France around the turn of the 20th century. Fauve artists used pure, brilliant colour aggressively applied straight from the paint tubes to create a sense of an explosion on the canvas.

The Fauves painted directly from nature, as the Impressionists had before them, but Fauvist works were invested with a strong expressive reaction to the subjects portrayed. First formally exhibited in Paris in 1905, Fauvist paintings shocked visitors to the annual Salon d’Automne; one of these visitors was the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who, because of the violence of their works, dubbed the painters fauves
